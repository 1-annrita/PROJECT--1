    <h1>CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>

    <P>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking,
        software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible
        resources, and economies of scale.
        Cloud computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most by
        avoiding work like procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning. As cloud computing has grown in popularity,
        several deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type of
        deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexibility, and management.Understanding the
        differences between these deployment strategies can help you decide what set of services is right for your
        needs.</P>

        <h2>ON-PREMISES</h2>
        <P>Before the cloud, companies and organizations hosted and maintained hardware such as compute, storage, and
            networking equipment in their own data centers. They often allocated entire infrastructure departments to
            take
            care of their data centers, which resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation
            impossible. As internet use became more widespread, the demand for compute, storage, and networking
            equipment
            increased.
            For some companies and organizations, the cost of maintaining a large physical presence was unsustainable.
            To
            solve this problem, cloud computing emerged.</P>
