        <p>Purpose of monitoring.When operating a website like the employee directory application on AWS, you might have
            questions like the following: How many people are visiting my site day to day? How can I track the number of
            visitors over time? How will I know if the website is having performance or availability issues? What
            happens if my Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance runs out of capacity? Will I be alerted if
            my website goes down?</p>

        <p class="rita">You need a way to collect and analyze data about the operational health and usage of your
            resources. The act
            of collecting, analyzing, and using data to make decisions or answer questions about your IT resources and
            systems is called monitoring. Monitoring provides a near real-time pulse on your system and helps answer the
            previous questions. You can use the data you collect to watch for operational issues caused by events like
            overuse of resources, application flaws, resource misconfiguration, or security-related events.Think of the
            data collected through monitoring as outputs of the system, or metrics.</p>

        <p class="success">Use metrics to solve problems.The AWS resources that host your solutions create various forms
            of data that
            you might be interested in collecting.Each individual data point that a resource creates is a metric.
            Metrics that are collected and analyzed over time become statistics, such as average CPU utilization over
            time showing a spike.</p>

        <p class="success feedback">One way to evaluate the health of an EC2 instance is through CPU
            utilization.Generally
            speaking, if an EC2
            instance has a high CPU utilization, it can mean a flood of requests. Or it can reflect a process that has
            encountered an error and is consuming too much of the CPU.When analyzing CPU utilization, take a process
            that exceeds a specific threshold for an unusual length of time. Use that abnormal event as a cue to either
            manually or automatically resolve the issue through actions like scaling the instance.CPU utilization is one
            example of a metric. Other examples of metrics that EC2 instances have are network utilization, disk
            performance, memory utilization, and the logs created by the applications running on top of Amazon EC2.</p>
